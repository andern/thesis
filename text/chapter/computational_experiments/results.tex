\subsection{Experiment 1}
Figure \ref{fig:constructb1} shows the number of seconds used to solve problems
of different sizes $n$, with two different implementations.
The figure shows a plot of 
\begin{tabular}
\begin{table}
    
\end{table}
\end{tabular}

Results. Nice looking tables and charts of results.

    \caption{Seconds used to solve all $s(1, n)$ subinstances of randomly
             generated problems of size $n$. The x-axis represents $n$, the
             number of edges in the network, i.e. the number of
             variables/columns in the QP problem. The y-axis represents the
             number of seconds used.}
