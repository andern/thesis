\subsubsection{Experiment 1}
Table \ref{table:expone} shows an excerpt of the test results.
A table with results for all $n=100,200,\ldots,2000$ can found in Appendix
\ref{app:exp1}.
We see that, as the problem size grows, the \texttt{construct\_clp}
implementation becomes faster and faster in comparison with
\texttt{naive\_clp}.
This is likely due to the fact that we save more time for each problem we do
\emph{not} need to solve, as $n$ grows. There are also more subinstances as
$n$ grows, making room for more subinstances that we might not have to solve.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \caption{An excerpt of test results from experiment 1. The values in the
             cClp and nClp columns are the average running times in seconds for
             solving instances with $s(1, n)$ subinstances, ten times. The
             faster column represents how much faster, in percent, cClp is
             compared with nClp.}
    \label{table:expone}
\begin{tabular}{rrrc}
    $n$ & cClp  & nClp  & Faster \\ \hline
    500 & 4.9   & 5.9   & 16.9\% \\
   1000 & 42.1  & 53.0  & 20.6\% \\
   1500 & 181.5 & 234.5 & 22.6\% \\
   2000 & 547.1 & 710.2 & 23.0\%
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Experiment 2}
Table \ref{table:exptwo} shows the test results from this experiment. We see
that, as $b$ increases, the \texttt{construct\_clp} implementation becomes
faster and faster in comparison with \texttt{naive\_clp}.
This is likely due to the fact that as the tree grows in size, the chance that
an unsolved subinstance is distinct, decreases.
\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
\caption{Test results from experiment 2. The values in the cClp and nClp
         columns are the average running times in seconds for solving
         instances where $n = 50$, with $s(b, 50)$ subinstances, ten times.
         The Faster column represents how much faster, in percent, cClp is
         compared with nClp. The Skipped column represents how many
         subinstances we could skip solving because its solution was found
         in the tree.
         }
\begin{tabular}{rrrcr}
      $b$ & cClp & nClp & Faster & Skipped\\ \hline
       1  & 0.03 & 0.04 & 25.0\% & 13.6 \\
       2  & 0.64 & 0.94 & 31.9\% & 531.7 \\
       3  & 7.06 & 15.90 & 55.6\% & 11391.3 \\
       4  & 77.59 & 188.83 & 58.9\% & 168913.5 \\
       5  & 586.54 & 1758.23 & 66.6\% 
\end{tabular}
\label{table:exptwo}
\end{table}

Figur \ref{fig:constructincb} shows a plot of the number of seconds used to
solve, on average, one subinstance, as $b$ increases.
We see that as $b$ increases, the number of
seconds to solve one subinstance decreases with \texttt{construct\_clp},
but with \texttt{naive\_clp}, it does not change much. This behavior is very
much expected, especially considering our earlier assessment in this
experiment, and in Experiment 1.
