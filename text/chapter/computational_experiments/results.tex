    \caption{Seconds used to solve all $s$ subinstances of randomly generated
             problems, when $b = 1$. The x-axis represents $n$, the number of
             edges in the network, i.e. the number of variables/columns in the
             QP problem. The y-axis represents the number of seconds used.}
