In this chapter, we discuss how to represent all subinstances of some arbitrary
instance $\mathcal{Q}$. We also discuss how to identify 
subinstances to which we do not already know the solution.
We construct a \emph{tree} of all subinstances with distinct optimal solutions.
This tree enables us to efficiently check whether some modifier forms a
subinstance with an unknown solution.

If we were to try to solve all $2^n$ possible subinstances of an
instance, we would most likely end up solving a huge amount of subinstances
with the same optimal solutions. This is evident in some of the real
instances; when we solve the unmodified instance \texttt{vlarge},
we already have the solution to $2^{1749}$ of its possible subinstances, i.e.
$|\mathcal{Z}_0| = 1749$.
Just trying to unnecessarily solve all these subinstances---let alone store the
solutions---would be a huge waste of resources.
Instead, we try to identify subinstances with distinct optimal solutions.
\begin{comment}
A good starting point is to find all the subsets of $\mathcal{N}_0$ and
use them as modifiers of $Q$. This is equivalent to forcing non-zero
variables in the optimal solution of the unchanged instance $Q$, to zero.
Recall from the previous section that if $\mathcal{Q}$ is known, knowing the
modifier $\mathcal{M}_k$ is sufficient to identify the subinstance
$\mathcal{Q}_k$.
While modifiers $\mathcal{M}_k$ such that
$\mathcal{M}_k \subseteq \mathcal{N}_0$ ensures that $x_k^*\neq x_0^*$,
it does not assure us that $x_k^* \neq x_l^*$ for all $l=1,2,\ldots,s-1$.
To make sure that we only solve subinstances with distinct optimal solutions,
we need to identify modifiers $\mathcal{M}_k$ such that
$\mathcal{M}_k \not \subset \mathcal{Z}_l$
for \emph{all} $l=1,2,\ldots,s-1$.

Consider a set $\mathbb{U}\subseteq \left\{{0,1,\ldots,\sigma(\beta, n)-1}\right\}$ of indices
such that if $i,j \in \mathbb{U}$, and $i \neq j$, then $x_i^* \neq x_j^*$.
With such a set; given an arbitrary modifier $\mathcal{M}_k$, we can check
if there exists an index $l \in \mathbb{U}$ such that $x_k^* = x_l^*$. By
checking each index $l \in \mathbb{U}$, we only need to confirm that
$\mathcal{M}_k \subseteq \mathcal{Z}_l$ to know that $x_k^* = x_l^*$. However,
checking \emph{all} members of $\mathbb{U}$ might not be practical when the set
grows large. With a tree representation of $\mathbb{U}$, we can (dis)confirm
that $x_k^* = x_l^*$ for a modifier $\mathcal{M}_k$ without checking all
indices in the set.

%To make sure that we do not solve any unnecessary subinstances, we need
%find modifiers $\mathcal{M}_k$ such that
%$\mathcal{M}_k \not \subset \mathcal{Z}_l$
%for \emph{all} $l=1,2,\ldots,2^n-1$.

%Consider a set $\mathbb{U}$ that contains all subinstances $\mathcal{Q}_k$
%such that $x_k^* \neq x_l^*$ for all
%$\mathcal{Q}_l \in \mathbb{U} \backslash \mathcal{Q}_k$.
%While constructing such a set, we have to obey the following rule:
%If $\mathcal{M}_k$ is a subset of any $\mathcal{Z}_l \in \mathbb{U}$, we know
%that $x_k^* = x_l^*$ and therefore we do not add $\mathcal{Q}_k$ to
%$\mathbb{U}$;
%if however, the opposite is true, we add $\mathcal{Q}_k$ to $\mathbb{U}$.
%With such a set; given an arbitrary modifier $\mathcal{M}_k$, we could check
%whether we would need to solve its corresponding subinstance $\mathcal{Q}_k$ or
%not.
%The downside is that we need to check all elements in $\mathbb{U}$ for
%each modifier we want to check.
%By constructing a tree instead of a set, we could check a modifier without
%checking it against all previous subinstances we have solved.

We define a tree as an ordered pair $G = (V,E)$ comprising a set $V$ of
vertices together with a set $E$ of edges.
Let each vertex $v_k \in V$ represent an index $k \in \mathbb{U}$.
For each vertex $v_k$ and its parent $v_l$, $\mathcal{M}_l$ must
be a subset of $\mathcal{M}_k$.
Put differently, each vertex and its corresponding modifier must be
an extension of the modifier of its parent.
The root $v_0$, which does not have a parent, has a modifier that is equal
to the empty set, i.e. $\mathcal{M}_0 = \emptyset$.

Algorithm \ref{alg:find} describes an algorithm for finding the index
$i \in \mathbb{U}$ for a given modifier $\mathcal{M}_l$ such that
$x_l^* = x_i^*$.
Note that the return value
on the last line of the algorithm is implementation specific, but it should be
a value that somehow tells us that we have not previously found the solution to
$\mathcal{Q}_l$.

Consider a tree $G$ with a vertex set
$V=\left\{0,2,3,7,8,10,12,15,16,28,29\right\}$
and an edge set
$E = \left\{\left\{0,2\right\}, \left\{0,8\right\}, \left\{0,16\right\},
\left\{2,3\right\}, \left\{8,10\right\}\right.$, $\left.\left\{8,12\right\},
\left\{16,28\right\},\right.$
$\left.\left\{3,7\right\}, \left\{12,15\right\},
\left\{28,29\right\}\right\}$
and the following sets:
\[
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \mathcal{M}_0    = \left\{{}\right\}           & \mathcal{Z}_0    = \left\{{1,3}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_2    = \left\{{2}\right\}          & \mathcal{Z}_2    = \left\{{2,3,5}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_3    = \left\{{1,2}\right\}        & \mathcal{Z}_3    = \left\{{1,2,4,5}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_7    = \left\{{1,2,3}\right\}      & \mathcal{Z}_7    = \left\{{1,2,3,5}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_8    = \left\{{4}\right\}          & \mathcal{Z}_8    = \left\{{1,4,5}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_{10} = \left\{{2,4}\right\}        & \mathcal{Z}_{10} = \left\{{2,3,4,5}\right\}
    \end{array}
~
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \mathcal{M}_{12} = \left\{{3,4}\right\}        & \mathcal{Z}_{12} = \left\{{4,3,1}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_{15} = \left\{{1,2,3,4}\right\}    & \mathcal{Z}_{15} = \left\{{1,2,3,4}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_{16} = \left\{{5}\right\}          & \mathcal{Z}_{16} = \left\{{1,3,5}\right\} \\

        \mathcal{M}_{29} = \left\{{1,3,4,5}\right\}    & \mathcal{Z}_{29} = \left\{{1,2,3,4,5}\right\}

The tree $G$ is a tree representation of a set $\mathbb{U}$ of some
$\mathcal{Q}$ with $5$ variables.
Figure \ref{fig:find} shows how Algorithm \ref{alg:find} would work with input
$(\mathcal{M}_{14} = \left\{{2,3,4}\right\}, v_0)$.
The left side of the figure shows the tree G.

        We see that $\mathcal{M}_{16} \not \subseteq \mathcal{M}_{14}$, so we
        ignore the subtree of $v_{16}$ completely. However, $\mathcal{M}_2 \cup
        \mathcal{M}_8 \subseteq \mathcal{M}_{14}$, so we
        continue searching from the vertices $v_2$ and $v_8$.

        Since $\mathcal{M}_3 \not \subseteq \mathcal{M}_{14}$, we stop the
        search and conclude that the subtree of $v_2$ does not contain
        the solution to $\mathcal{Q}_{14}$.

        We see that $\mathcal{M}_{10} \subseteq \mathcal{M}_{14}$ and that
        $\mathcal{M}_{12} \subseteq \mathcal{M}_{14}$, so we continue
        searching from the vertices $v_{10}$ and $v_{12}$.
