A general formulation of non-linear optimization problems is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:generalqp}
    \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} f(x) \quad \textrm{subject to}
    \begin{cases}
        ~c_i(x) = 0,   & i \in \mathcal{E}, \\
        ~c_i(x) \ge 0, & i \in \mathcal{I},
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $f$ and the functions $c_i$ are all smooth, real-valued functions on a
subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ are two finite
sets of indices~\cite{nocedal}.

The problem discussed in this thesis has (from (\ref{eq:obj})) a convex,
quadratic, separable objective function
\[
    f(x) = x^T H x + b^T x
\]
and linear constraints. It qualifies as a convex QP problem and is formulated in
(\ref{eq:thesisqp}) as
\[
    \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} f(x)\quad\textrm{subject to}~Ax = 0, ~l \leq x \leq u
\]
%\begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:thesisqp}
%    \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} f(x)
%    \min_{x_{\textrm{min}} \le x \le x_{\textrm{max}}} f(x)
%    \min_{l \le x \le u} f(x)
%    \quad \textrm{subject to}
%    ~
%    Ax = 0
%    ~
%    \textrm{and}
%    ~
%    l \le x \le u
%\end{equation}
where $H$ is a positive semidefinite diagonal $n \times n$ matrix, $A$ is a
$m \times n$ oriented incidence matrix, and $b, l, u$ and $x$ are vectors in
$\mathbb{R}^n$.

The function $f$ is called the objective function of
the problem. In (\ref{eq:obj}) and (\ref{eq:thesisqp}), $f$ consists of a
quadratic term ($x^T H x$) and a linear term ($b^T x$).

In practical applications, a large proportion of the diagonal elements of $H$
and $b$ are zero.
For the non-zero elements of $H$, we typically have
$10^{-5} \le h_i \le 10^{-1}$.
Here $h_i$ denotes the $i$th diagonal element of $H$.
For the non-zero elements $b_i$ of vector $b$, we typically have
$10 \le |b_i| \le 70$. All elements of $l$ and $u$ are non-positive 
and non-negative, respectively. However, the methods developed in this thesis
do not require these values.
These values come part from conversations with Goodtech, and
part from a couple of real instances that they have supplied.
The next section describes the supplied instances in detail.
