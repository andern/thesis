\section{Mapping Subinstances}
In this section we will discuss how to map all subinstances of some arbitrary
instance $\mathcal{Q}$. We will also discuss how to find 
subinstances that we do not already know the solution to.
We will construct a \emph{tree} of these ``unique'' solutions which will allow
us to efficiently check if some modifier will form a subinstance with an
unknown solution.

If we were to try to solve all $2^n$ possible subinstances of an
instance, we would most likely end up solving a huge amount of subinstances
with the same optimal solution. This is evident in some of the real
instances; when we solve the unmodified instance \texttt{vlarge}, we already
have the solution to $2^{1749}$ of its possible subinstances, i.e.
$|\mathcal{Z}_0| = 1749$.
Just trying to unnecessarily solve all these subinstances---let alone store the
solutions---would be a huge waste of resources.
Instead, we try to find subinstances that we do not know the solution to.
A good starting point would be to find all the subsets of $\mathcal{N}_0$ and
use them as modifiers of $Q$. That would be equivalent to forcing non-zero
variables in the optimal solution of the unchanged instance $Q$, to zero.
Recall from the previous section that if $\mathcal{Q}$ is known, the modifier
$\mathcal{M}_k$ is enough to find the subinstance $\mathcal{Q}_k$ for some
$k=1,2,\ldots,2^n-1$.
While finding modifiers $\mathcal{M}_k$ such that
$\mathcal{M}_k \subseteq \mathcal{N}_0$ would assure us that $x_k^*\neq x_0^*$,
it does not assure us that $x_k^* \neq x_l^*$ for all $l=1,2,\ldots,2^n-1$.
To make sure that we do not solve any unnecessary subinstances, we need
find modifiers $\mathcal{M}_k$ such that
$\mathcal{M}_k \not \subset \mathcal{Z}_l$
for \emph{all} $l=1,2,\ldots,2^n-1$.

Consider a set $\mathbb{U}$ that contains all subinstances $\mathcal{Q}_k$
such that $x_k^* \neq x_l^*$ for all
$\mathcal{Q}_l \in \mathbb{U} \backslash \mathcal{Q}_k$.
While constructing such a set, we have to obey the following rule:
If $\mathcal{M}_k$ is a subset of any $\mathcal{Z}_l \in \mathbb{U}$, we know
that $x_k^* = x_l^*$ and therefore we do not add $\mathcal{Q}_k$ to
$\mathbb{U}$;
if however, the opposite is true, we add $\mathcal{Q}_k$ to $\mathbb{U}$.
With such a set; given an arbitrary modifier $\mathcal{M}_k$, we could check
whether we would need to solve its corresponding subinstance $\mathcal{Q}_k$ or
not.
The downside is that we need to check all elements in $\mathbb{U}$ for
each modifier we want to check.

By constructing a tree instead of a set, we could check a modifier without
checking it against all previous subinstances we have solved. Let each node
represent a subinstance $\mathcal{Q}_k$. As with the set $\mathbb{U}$, we only
allow subinstances $\mathcal{Q}_k$ such that $x_k^* \neq x_l^*$ for all
subinstances $\mathcal{Q}_l$ in the tree where $l \neq k$. For each node in the
tree representing a subinstance $\mathcal{Q}_k$ and its parent node
representing a subinstance $\mathcal{Q}_l$, $\mathcal{M}_l$ must be a subset of
$\mathcal{M}_k$. Put differently, each node and its corresponding modifier in
the tree must be an extension of the modifier of its parent node. The root node
which does not have any parent node, has a modifier that is equal to the empty
set, i.e. $\mathcal{M}_0 = \emptyset$.

\input{include/find_algo}

Algorithm \ref{alg:find} describes
an algorithm for finding the index $i$ of some $\mathcal{Q}_i$ for a given
modifier $\mathcal{M}_l$ such that $x_l^* = x_i^*$. Note that the return value
on the last line of the algorithm is implementation specific, but it should be
a value that somehow tells us that we have not previously found the solution to
$\mathcal{Q}_l$.

        We see that $\mathcal{M}_1$, $\mathcal{M}_2$ and $\mathcal{M}_4$ are

        of either $\mathcal{Z}_1$, $\mathcal{Z}_2$ or $\mathcal{Z}_4$.
        We then continue to search from the nodes $1$, $2$, and $4$.

        Since $\mathcal{M}_5$ is a subset of $\mathcal{M}_l$ and that

        $\mathcal{M}_l$ and that $\mathcal{M}_l$ is not a subset of
        $\mathcal{M}_8$. We would continue the search, but since
        $\mathcal{Q}_8$ does not have any child nodes, we stop the search
        and conclude that the subtree of $\mathcal{Q}_1$ does not contain
        a solution for $\mathcal{Q}_l$.
