\section{Mapping Subinstances}
In the previous section we were interested in identifying subinstances where
we had already found a solution. In this section, we are interested in
subinstances we have \emph{not} yet found a solution for.

After solving some $\mathcal{Q}_k$ to achieve some optimal solution $x_k^*$, we
also achieve the set of zero-variables in $x_k^*$, denoted by $\mathcal{Z}_k$.
The cardinality of $\mathcal{Z}_k$, i.e. $|\mathcal{Z}_k|$, determines the
number of subinstances that share the solution $x_k^*$. In contrast, we denote
the set of variables that are non-zero in $x_k^*$ by $\mathcal{N}_k$.
Additionally, the cardinality of $\mathcal{N}_k$, i.e. $|\mathcal{N}_k|$,
determines the number of subinstances where $\mathcal{M}_l$ is some 
extension of $\mathcal{M}_k$ for some $l=1,2,\ldots,2^n-1$.
