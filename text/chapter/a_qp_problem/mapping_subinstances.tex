\section{Mapping Subinstances}
In this section we will discuss how to map all subinstances of some arbitrary
instance $\mathcal{Q}$. We will also discuss how to generate
subinstances that we do not already know the solution to.
We will construct a \emph{tree} of these ``unique'' solutions which will allow
us to efficiently check if some modifier will form a subinstance with a unique
solution or not.

After solving some $\mathcal{Q}_k$ to achieve some optimal solution $x_k^*$, we
also achieve the set of zero-variables in $x_k^*$, denoted by $\mathcal{Z}_k$.
The cardinality of $\mathcal{Z}_k$, i.e. $|\mathcal{Z}_k|$, determines the
number of subinstances that share the solution $x_k^*$.
Similarily, the cardinality of $\mathcal{N}_k$, i.e. $|\mathcal{N}_k|$,
determines the number of subinstances where $\mathcal{M}_l$ is some 
extension of $\mathcal{M}_k$ for some $l=1,2,\ldots,2^n-1$.
