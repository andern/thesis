\section{Mapping Subinstances}
In this section we will discuss how to map all subinstances of some arbitrary
instance $\mathcal{Q}$. We will also discuss how to find 
subinstances that we do not already know the solution to.
We will construct a \emph{tree} of these ``unique'' solutions which will allow
us to efficiently check if some modifier will form a subinstance with an
unknown solution.

If we were to try to solve all $2^n$ possible subinstances of an
instance, we would most likely end up solving a huge amount of subinstances
with the same optimal solution. This is evident in some of the real
instances; when we solve the unmodified instance \texttt{vlarge}, we already
have the solution to $2^{1749}$ of its possible subinstances, i.e.
$|\mathcal{Z}_0| = 1749$.
Just trying to unnecessarily solve all these subinstances---let alone store the
solutions---would be a huge waste of resources.
Instead, we try to find subinstances that we do not know the solution to.
A good starting point would be to find all the subsets of $\mathcal{N}_0$ and
use them as modifiers of $Q$. That would be equivalent to forcing non-zero
variables in the optimal solution of the unchanged instance $Q$, to zero.
Recall from the previous section that if $\mathcal{Q}$ is known, the modifier
$\mathcal{M}_k$ is enough to find the subinstance $\mathcal{Q}_k$ for some
$k=1,2,\ldots,2^n-1$.
While finding modifiers $\mathcal{M}_k$ such that
$\mathcal{M}_k \subseteq \mathcal{N}_0$ would assure us that $x_k^*\neq x_0^*$,
it does not assure us that $x_k^* \neq x_l^*$ for all $l=1,2,\ldots,2^n-1$.
To make sure that we do not solve any unnecessary subinstances, we need
find modifiers $\mathcal{M}_k$ such that
$\mathcal{M}_k \not \subset \mathcal{Z}_l$
for \emph{all} $l=1,2,\ldots,2^n-1$.

Consider a set $\mathbb{U}$ that contains all subinstances $\mathcal{Q}_k$
such that $x_k^* \neq x_l^*$ for all
$\mathcal{Q}_l \in \mathbb{U} \backslash \mathcal{Q}_k$.
While constructing such a set, we have to obey the following rule:
If $\mathcal{M}_k$ is a subset of any $\mathcal{Z}_l \in \mathbb{U}$, we know
that $x_k^* = x_l^*$ and therefore we do not add $\mathcal{Q}_k$ to
$\mathbb{U}$;
if however, the opposite is true, we add $\mathcal{Q}_k$ to $\mathbb{U}$.
With such a set; given an arbitrary modifier $\mathcal{M}_k$, we could check
whether we would need to solve its corresponding subinstance $\mathcal{Q}_k$ or
not.
The downside is that we need to check all elements in $\mathbb{U}$ for
each modifier we want to check.
By constructing a tree instead of a set, we could check a modifier without
checking it against all previous subinstances we have solved.

We define a tree as an ordered pair $G = (V,E)$ comprising a set $V$ of
vertices together with a set $E$ of edges.
Let each vertex $v_k \in V$ represent a subinstance $\mathcal{Q}_k$.
As with the set $\mathbb{U}$, we only allow vertices $v_k$ such that
$x_k^* \neq x_l^*$ for all vertices $v_l$ where $l \neq k$.
Additionally, for each vertex $v_k$ and its parent $v_l$, $\mathcal{M}_l$ must
be a subset of $\mathcal{M}_k$.
Put differently, each vertex and its corresponding modifier in the tree must be
an extension of the modifier of its parent.
The root $v_0$ which does not have a parent, has a modifier that is equal
to the empty set, i.e. $\mathcal{M}_0 = \emptyset$.

\input{include/find_algo}

Algorithm \ref{alg:find} describes
an algorithm for finding the index $i$ of some $\mathcal{Q}_i$ for a given
modifier $\mathcal{M}_l$ such that $x_l^* = x_i^*$. Note that the return value
on the last line of the algorithm is implementation specific, but it should be
a value that somehow tells us that we have not previously found the solution to
$\mathcal{Q}_l$.

Consider a tree $G$ with a vertex set $V = \left\{{v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_{10}}\right\}$
and an edge set $E = \left\{{\left\{{0,1}\right\},\left\{{0,2}\right\},\left\{{0,3}\right\},\left\{{0,4}\right\},\left\{{1,5}\right\},\left\{{2,6}\right\},\left\{{4,7}\right\},\left\{{5,8}\right\},\left\{{6,9}\right\},\left\{{9,10}\right\}}\right\}$
and the following values:
\[
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \mathcal{M}_0 = \left\{{}\right\}           & \mathcal{Z}_0 = \left\{{1,3}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_1 = \left\{{2}\right\}          & \mathcal{Z}_1 = \left\{{2,3,5}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_2 = \left\{{4}\right\}          & \mathcal{Z}_2 = \left\{{4,1,5}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_3 = \left\{{5}\right\}          & \mathcal{Z}_3 = \left\{{5,1,3}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_4 = \left\{{2,4}\right\}        & \mathcal{Z}_4 = \left\{{2,4,3,5}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_5 = \left\{{2,1}\right\}        & \mathcal{Z}_5 = \left\{{2,1,4,5}\right\}
    \end{array}
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \mathcal{M}_6 = \left\{{4,3}\right\}        & \mathcal{Z}_6 = \left\{{4,3,1}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_7 = \left\{{2,4,1}\right\}      & \mathcal{Z}_7 = \left\{{2,4,1,3}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_8 = \left\{{2,1,3}\right\}      & \mathcal{Z}_8 = \left\{{2,1,3,5}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_9 = \left\{{4,3,5}\right\}      & \mathcal{Z}_9 = \left\{{4,3,5,2}\right\} \\
        \mathcal{M}_{10} = \left\{{4,3,5,1}\right\} & \mathcal{Z}_{10} = \left\{{4,3,5,1,2}\right\} \\
    \end{array}
\]
Figure \ref{fig:find} shows how Algorithm \ref{alg:find} would work with input
$(\left\{{1,2,3,4}\right\}, v_0)$. The left side of the figure shows the tree
specified above. See Appendix \ref{app:tree} for an alternative representation
of the tree.

        We see that $\mathcal{M}_1$, $\mathcal{M}_2$ and $\mathcal{M}_4$ are
        subsets of $\mathcal{M}_l$. However, $\mathcal{M}_l$ is not a subset
        of either $\mathcal{Z}_1$, $\mathcal{Z}_2$ or $\mathcal{Z}_4$.
        Therefore we continue to search from the nodes $1$, $2$, and $4$.

        Since $\mathcal{M}_5$ is a subset of $\mathcal{M}_l$ and that
        $\mathcal{M}_l$ is not a subset of $\mathcal{Z}_5$, we continue
        searching. Continuing, we see that $\mathcal{M}_8$ is a subset of
        $\mathcal{M}_l$ and that $\mathcal{M}_l$ is not a subset of
        $\mathcal{M}_8$. We would continue the search, but since
        $\mathcal{Q}_8$ does not have any child nodes, we stop the search
        and conclude that the subtree of $\mathcal{Q}_1$ does not contain
        a solution for $\mathcal{Q}_l$.
