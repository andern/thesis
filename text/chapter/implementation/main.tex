\section{Implementation}
Recall from Chapter \ref{ch:qp} that we discussed limiting the amount
of subinstances to solve. We did this by introducing a limit on the number of
simultaneous break-downs in the network.
Another approach is to implement a discrete-event simulator (DES). Each event
occurs at a particular instant in time that changes the state of the system.
In this case, each event would either be a breakdown in the network, or that
a breakdown is fixed.

The difference in these two approaches are prominent, but they share the same
core, namely a QP solver. In this chapter we first discuss the implementation
of the solver declared in Chapter \ref{ch:slp}, before we move on to the
implementation of the two approaches of solving several subinstances.
