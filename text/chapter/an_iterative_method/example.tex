\section{A Numerical Example}
\label{sec:example}
Consider the quadratic program $\mathcal{Q}$:
\[
\begin{array}{lcrcrcrcrcl}
\textrm{Minimize}   & & x^2 &+& y^2 &-& 2 x &-& 2 y \\
\textrm{subject to} & &     & &     & &   x &+&   y &\leq& 3 \\
\textrm{and}        & &     & &     & &   x &-&   y &\leq& 1 \\
\textrm{and}        & &     & &     &-&   x &+& 3 y &\leq& 4 \\
\textrm{and}        & &     & &     & &   x &,&   y &\geq& 0
\end{array}
\]
and let $x^*$ denote one of its optimal points and let $f$ denote its objective
function.

Let $x_0 = (0,0)$ such that $T_0 = -2x - 2y$.
Figure \ref{fig:lp1} shows the feasible region of $\mathcal{L}_0$ and
$\mathcal{Q}$\footnote{
    The feasible region of $\mathcal{L}_k$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are equal for all
    $k$ as the constraints never change during the iterations of the algorithm.
}
, along with $T_0$ evaluated at $x_0$ (line in red), the optimal solution
$\hat{x}_0$ of $\mathcal{L}_0$\footnote{
    $\mathcal{L}_0$ has multiple optimal solutions so $\hat{x}_0$ may differ
    between LP implementations
}
, the optimal solution $x^*$ of $\mathcal{Q}$ and the contours of $f$.
On the right it also shows $\mathcal{L}_0$ in standard form (note that the
objective has been negated.)

\input{include/slpfirst}

We perform a line search between the points $x_0$ and $\hat{x}_0$.
We find a function $m$ of $\alpha$ that range all points collinear with $x_0$
and $\hat{x}_0$:
\[
f(\alpha x_0 + (1-\alpha)x_0^*) = 5\alpha^2 - 4\alpha -1 = m(\alpha)
\]
To find the minimum of this one-dimensional convex parabola we set
$m^\prime(\alpha) = 0$ and solve for $\alpha$ to achieve $\alpha = 0.4$
(see Figure \ref{fig:steplength}).
Note that $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ because the unconstrained minimum of $f$ is
inside the feasible region.
Now let
\[
x_1Â = 0.4x_0 + 0.6\hat{x}_0 = (1.2, 0.6)
\]
and let us apply Equation (\ref{eq:texp}) to calculate a Taylor series
expansion at $x_1$:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
T_1 &=& -\left[
         \begin{array}{cc}
            1.2 & 0.6
         \end{array}
         \right]

         \left[
         \begin{array}{cc}
            1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1
         \end{array}
         \right]
         
         \left[
         \begin{array}{c}
             1.2 \\ [5pt] 0.6
         \end{array}
         \right]
         + 2
         \left[
         \begin{array}{cc}
            1.2 & 0.6
         \end{array}
         \right]
         
         \left[
         \begin{array}{cc}
            1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1
         \end{array}
         \right]
         
         \left[
         \begin{array}{c}
            x \\ y
         \end{array}
         \right] \\
         
     & & +
         \left[
         \begin{array}{cc}
            -2 & -2
         \end{array}
         \right]
         
         \left[
         \begin{array}{c}
            x \\ y
         \end{array}
         \right] \\ [15pt]
    &=& \displaystyle 0.4x - 0.8y - 1.8
\end{array}
\]

\input{include/slpsecond}

Now, we minimize $T_1$ subject to the original constraints and call the LP for
$\mathcal{L}_1$.
Assume $\mathcal{L}_1$ has optimal solution $\hat{x}_1$
(See Figure \ref{fig:lp2}).

\input{include/slpthird}

Again we perform a line search, but this time between the points $x_1$ and
$\hat{x}_1$ and find that $\alpha = 0.73$, $x_2 = (0.88, 0.8)$ and
$T_2 = -0.25x -0.4y -0.4$.
Minimize $T_2$ subject to the original constraints and call the LP for
$\mathcal{L}_2$.
The optimal solution $\hat{x}_2$ of $\mathcal{L}_2$ is $(1.25, 1.75)$.
Performing line search between $x_2$ and $\hat{x}_2$ we get that
$\alpha = 0.77$ and that $x_3 = (0.96, 1.02)$.

\input{include/slpfourth}

Assume $\epsilon = 0.5$, which imples that
$\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_3)}{|f(x_2)|} \leq \epsilon$, so we stop and return $x_3$
as our solution.
