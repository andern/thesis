SLP was first referenced in \cite{slp61}, a paper by Griffith and Stewart in
1961~\cite{boggs1985numerical}.
They described a procedure they called Mathematical Approximation Programming
(MAP) that was in use at Shell Oil Company at the time. The paper is considered
a classic in the field of optimization

SLP is a differential technique which utilizes the linear programming algorithm
repetitively in such a way that the solution of a linear problem can converge
to the solution of the nonlinear problem~\cite{slp61}.
The results in the previous section show
us that applying an SLP algorithm to a QP problem with the characteristics
mentioned in Section \ref{sec:problem}, with an initial guess 0, will give us
an approximate solution deviating less than $5\%$ from the optimal objective
value, after only one iteration.
