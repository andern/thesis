\begin{abstract}
Goodtech and MathConsult have developed tools to compute the reliability of
delivery in a masked network where every link has an error rate.
This method is based on reliability theory to find actual error cases for
further analysis, and optimization theory to compute an optimal delivery
through the network for every error case.
The optimization problems are formulated as Quadratic Programming (QP)
problems.
Because the number of possible error cases increases rapidly as the size of the
network increases, it is crucial that every error case is analyzed very
quickly.
The aim is to develop a solver for effectively solving problems
\begin{inparaenum}
  \item with a problem size of 100 to 2000 variables;
  \item with sparse matrices;
  \item with positive-semidefinite quadratic terms in the objective function;
        and
  \item where the QP problem shall be solved many times with small variations
        in the constraints.

\section{Introduction}
As electrical transmission systems increase in complexity, it becomes
more difficult to understand how different components in the system interact.
We often aim to increase the utilization of such systems, and with that comes
the need for good planning and operational tools.
The Transmission System Operator (TSO) is faced
with increasing requirements regarding the reliability of load
delivery, and the cost of not delivering agreed energy can be
substantial\cite{digernes}.
The need for tools to assist the TSO in analyses that can help prevent
unreliable networks is important.
In \cite{digernes}, the authors state:
\begin{quote}
It is of utmost importance for the TSO to be able to perform detailed and
accurate reliability analyses; for the daily operation as well as for
future planning (comparison of reinforcement alternatives etc.). By
including power flow considerations in the calculations, the operator is
able to plan where to locate the spinning reserves to maximize the load
delivery reliability. Reliability analyses are also important for system
planning, for analyzing different alternatives for network reinforcement's
[sic] etc.\cite{digernes}
\end{quote}

Goodtech and MathConsult have developed a tool called PROMAPS
(Probability Methods Applied to Power Systems). It calculates the power
delivery as a function of demand, and the probability for undelivered
energy for each load branch in the system, and in the system as a whole
\cite{trond}. A typical calculation sequence in PROMAPS includes the
following main functions\cite{trond}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Creation of branch reliability models based on unit Markov models and
      composition and aggregation of states.
\item Selection of a subset of states containing all grid reliability states
      with a significant reliability.
\item Calculation of maximum power delivery capacity for each of the
      significant grid reliability states based on an object function with
      constraints.
\item Calculation of expected power shortage and creation of delivery
      reliability models based on the operations composition and aggregation.
\item Calculation of delivery probability, mean visiting duration and visiting
      frequency for functioning and failed delivery states.
\item Post calculation of various auxiliary variables including economic data.
\end{enumerate}
Among these six functions, the third main function was identified as the most
time-consuming, or more specifically, a call to a QP solver.

The maximum power
supply can be calculated by an objective function that represents the power
delivery profit. A typical objective function is
\[
J = -C_G - P^T \Phi C_D P + C_L P,
\]
where $J$ is the objective function value (E/s), $P$ is the branch power vector
($W$), $C_G$ is a line vector containing specific power generation cost
($E/J$), $\Phi$ is a diagonal matrix representing power loss ($1/W$), $C_D$ is
a diagonal matrix containing specific power transmission cost ($E/J$), and
$C_L$ is a line vector containing specific power delivery price ($E/J$).
The symbol $E$ is the economical unit\cite{digernes}.
